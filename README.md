# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis

  This project consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report.

### The purpose
  This work aims to replace the 9th-grade math and reading scores in Thomas High School and repeat the school district analysis to the board.

## Results

•	How is the district summary affected?
  
  Because the eligible scores were less from Thomas High School, the percentages were all slightly affected but not many differences (see the image below).

•	How is the school summary affected?

  The only change in the school summary was that the percentage of the math, reading and overall math & reading of Thomas High School had been dramatically increased.

•	How does replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores affect Thomas High School's performance relative to the other schools?
    Once replacing the ninth grader's scores in Thomas High School, only the math and reading scores from the school have tiny increased, so the overall top-five school 
   and bottom-five school positions remain the same. 
   The project successfully has no effect on the other graders in the same school and the other schools.

•	How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
 
 	Math and reading scores by grade: Both have been slightly increased in performance, involved in changing the whole school 9th graders' average math and reading scores, and 
    the percentage in these two subjects and overall percentage.
  
  	Scores by school spending: No changing
  
  	Scores by school size: No changing
  
  	Scores by school type: No changing

## Summarize
  
 After replacing the ninth grades of math and reading scores for Thomas High School to NaNs, less than 461 eligible scores were counted in all means, and the percentages in 9th graders were relatively affected. Therefore, the school district analysis has been impacted on the following four:

1-	The percentage of all the math, reading, and overall percentage were affected in the school district summary.

2-	The mean of graders' math and reading scores, the 9th graders, was changed slightly in Thomas High School.

3-	The percentage of all the math, reading, and overall percentage were affected in Thomas High School's school summary.

4-	The percentage of all the math, reading and the overall percentage were slightly affected in Thomas High School's top-five performance.
